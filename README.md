## What you get
After registration and login, the user can arrange the place and the attributes for the sought-after campsites. She/he can search for great seasides or wooded places, always  close to nature, maybe without w-lan or with a lot of space for the camper. The backend-business-logic finds the side, which matches most.

Most liked places can be bookmarked to plan the next trip.
